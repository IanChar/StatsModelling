Final project for APPM 5590: Statistical Modelling.

Given a dataset with apartment listings, the goal was to figure out how desirable the apartment will be in the market on
as scale of 1-5. To do this, we used ordinal logistic regression and random forests. More information on this can
be found in the final report.
